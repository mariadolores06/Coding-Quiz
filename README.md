# Coding-Quiz

## Description
This challenge was created to prepare you for interviews on your journey to becoming a developer. It is likely that you will be asked to complete a coding assessment as part of the interview process. To become more familiar with these tests, I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.

The timer will begin and you will be presented with the first question. The next question will appear after you select your answer. If you answer a question incorrectly then time will be subtracted from the timer. The game is over when all questions are answered of if the timer reaches 0. When the game is over, you can save your initials and score.
